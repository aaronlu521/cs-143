From this class, students will learn how to store, manage, and access large-scale data
using data management systems. Among many existing systems, our primary focus
will be on relational database management systems (RDBMS) and structured query
language (SQL), but we will review a few non-relational data management systems as
well.
The topics that will be covered in the class include:
  • Relational model
  • Relational algebra
  • SQL
  • Entity-relationship model
  • Relational design theory
  • Key data structure and algorithms for DBMS
  • Query execution
  • Transactions
  • NoSQL Database
  • Non-relational data processing
